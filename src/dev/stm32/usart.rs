//! An STM32 USART, on the character-device seam.
//!
//! # Two register maps, one chip
//!
//! ST redesigned this peripheral between the F4 and the F7, and the two
//! layouts are genuinely different rather than one being a superset:
//!
//! | | F1/F2/**F4** (RM0090 §30.6) | F0/F3/F7/L4/**H7** (RM0410 §34.8) |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | status | `SR` at `+0x00` | `ISR` at `+0x1c` |
//! | data | `DR` at `+0x04`, read *and* write | `RDR` at `+0x24`, `TDR` at `+0x28` |
//! | control | `CR1`–`CR3` at `+0x0c`…`+0x14` | `CR1`–`CR3` at `+0x00`…`+0x08` |
//! | baud | `BRR` at `+0x08` | `BRR` at `+0x0c` |
//! | clearing a flag | read `SR`, then read or write the data register | write a one to `ICR` at `+0x20` |
//! | `CR1` layout | `UE` at 13, `TE` at 3, `RE` at 2 | `UE` at 0, `TE` at 3, `RE` at 2 |
//!
//! Firmware written for one does not run on the other, so this is a
//! **construction property**, `variant`, and not something to average out. The
//! flag *positions* inside the status word do agree for the ten bits that
//! matter (`PE`, `FE`, `NF`, `ORE`, `IDLE`, `RXNE`, `TC`, `TXE`, `LBD`/`LBDF`,
//! `CTS`/`CTSIF`), so one set of semantics serves both and only the decode
//! differs.
//!
//! A third, **`"u5"`**, is the F7 layout grown up: the same offsets, plus
//! `RTOR` and `RQR` decoded, a `PRESC` at `+0x2c` and an `AUTOCR` at `+0x30`
//! (ST CMSIS `stm32u585xx.h` (Apache-2.0), `USART_TypeDef`; RM0456, the
//! USART chapter). It is named for the part it was written against, but the
//! H7, G4 and L4+ have the same FIFO-and-`PRESC` USART and only lack `AUTOCR`,
//! which reads as zero to firmware that never writes it. What it adds:
//!
//! * **`TEACK`/`REACK`** (`ISR` bits 21/22), set while `UE` and `TE`/`RE` are.
//!   `HAL_UART_Init` ends in `UART_CheckIdleState`, which polls them, so
//!   without them every HAL console times out before printing a byte.
//! * **The FIFO mode**, `CR1.FIFOEN`: eight bytes each way, `TXE` reading as
//!   `TXFNF` and `RXNE` as `RXFNE`, plus `TXFE`, `RXFF`, and the `TXFT`/`RXFT`
//!   thresholds `CR3.TXFTCFG`/`RXFTCFG` select. With `FIFOEN` clear the depth
//!   is one, which is the F7's behaviour exactly. The thresholds count what
//!   `HAL_UARTEx` counts: `TXFT` means at least that many *free* transmit
//!   entries, `RXFT` at least that many received bytes. `TXFE` is derived
//!   from the queue rather than latched, so `ICR.TXFECF` does not hold it
//!   clear while the FIFO stays empty.
//! * **`RQR.RXFRQ`/`TXFRQ`**, which flush the receive and transmit sides.
//! * **`UE` going low** discards whatever is queued and returns `ISR` to its
//!   reset value — "all current operations are discarded" — which is what
//!   firmware that toggles `UE` around a reconfiguration expects to find.
//!
//! An LPUART has the same register file with a 20-bit `BRR` and no `GTPR` or
//! `RTOR`; `lpuart = true` (with `variant = "u5"`) gives it exactly that.
//!
//! The default is `"f4"`, because [`machines/stm32f407.machine`] is an F407
//! and a property whose default matches the board it ships with is one fewer
//! line in the file.
//!
//! # What the flags mean here
//!
//! * `TXE` — the transmit holding register is free. Writing the data register
//!   clears it; the byte reaches the host on the next tick of this device's
//!   clock domain, and `TXE` sets again then. That is what makes back pressure
//!   real: a host that will not take a byte stalls a guest polling `TXE`,
//!   exactly as a slow wire would.
//! * `TC` — the shift register is empty as well. It sets when the byte
//!   actually goes, and firmware that waits on it before dropping `TE` or
//!   sleeping gets the answer it is waiting for.
//! * `RXNE` — a byte is in the receive register. There is **no FIFO** on an F4
//!   USART, so a second byte arriving before the first is read sets `ORE` and
//!   is lost, which is the overrun firmware is supposed to handle and usually
//!   does not.
//!
//! # The pins
//!
//! **There are none.** A USART's transmit pin carries a bit stream, and this
//! model's data path is [`host::chardev`](crate::host::chardev) — a byte at a
//! time, to a terminal. So `TX` and `RX` are not wires and a board does not
//! connect them to a GPIO's alternate-function inputs; the only pin here is
//! `irq`. Firmware still configures `MODER` and `AFR` for its `TX` pin and
//! that configuration is modelled faithfully by [`gpio`](super::gpio), because
//! firmware does it and expects the registers to read back — it simply is not
//! what carries the data. A peripheral whose pin genuinely *is* a level, an
//! SPI clock or a timer compare output, is the case the GPIO's `af{n}` inputs
//! exist for.
//!
//! Two *inputs* arrive from the reset and clock controller — `enable`, which
//! is `RCC_APB1ENR.USART2EN`, and `reset`, which is `RCC_APB1RSTR.USART2RST`.
//! A board draws them or it does not; an undrawn `enable` leaves the USART
//! clocked. [`gate`] has the rules and what a gated block does.
//!
//! # Baud rate
//!
//! `BRR` is stored and reported and **does not change the byte rate**. The
//! device moves at most one byte per tick of its clock domain, and a machine
//! file sets that domain to the character rate it wants. Modelling `BRR`
//! properly would mean a device recomputing its own event period from a
//! divisor, which is a real thing to want and is not what makes a console
//! work; [`Usart::baud_divisor`] reports the programmed value so a board that
//! cares can act on it.
//!

//!
//! ST **RM0090** rev 21 §30 ("Universal synchronous asynchronous receiver
//! transmitter") for the F4 layout, and ST **RM0410** rev 4 §34 for the F7's.
//! The `u5` layout is from ST **RM0456** (STM32U5), the USART and LPUART
//! chapters, with offsets and bit positions from the `USART_TypeDef` and
//! `USART_*_Pos` definitions in ST CMSIS `stm32u585xx.h` (Apache-2.0); what
//! `HAL_UART_Init` polls is from ST's BSD-3-Clause U5 HAL, read for behaviour.
//! No emulator source of any licence was consulted (`ROADMAP.md` §1).
