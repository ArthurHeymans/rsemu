//! The STM32 debug support block, `DBGMCU`.
//!
//! One class, `st.dbgmcu`. It is the smallest peripheral on the die and the
//! only one whose customer is not the firmware: three writable words and one
//! read-only identifier, sitting at `0xE004_2000` on the **external** private
//! peripheral bus, put there so that a debugger — not the program — can say
//! what the chip should keep doing while the core is stopped at a breakpoint.
//!
//! Without it, a board that models a watchdog is a board you cannot debug. Set
//! a breakpoint in a main loop that kicks the `IWDG`, wait at the prompt for
//! half a second, and the part resets under you; the bug you were chasing is
//! gone and a reset is in its place. `DBG_IWDG_STOP` is the bit that stops
//! that, and every real STM32 debug script sets it before it sets a
//! breakpoint.
//!
//! # The registers
//!
//! Four of them, at `0xE004_2000` (RM0090 §38.16):
//!
//! | Offset | Register | What it does |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `0x00` | `IDCODE` | read-only: `DEV_ID[11:0]` and `REV_ID[31:16]` |
//! | `0x04` | `CR` | `DBG_SLEEP`, `DBG_STOP`, `DBG_STANDBY`, `TRACE_IOEN`, `TRACE_MODE` |
//! | `0x08` | `APB1_FZ` | one freeze bit per APB1 peripheral, `DBG_IWDG_STOP` among them |
//! | `0x0c` | `APB2_FZ` | the same for APB2: the four advanced and general-purpose timers on it |
//!
//! `DEV_ID` is `0x413` on an STM32F405/407/415/417 (RM0090 §38.6.1) and
//! `REV_ID` is the silicon revision, `0x1000` for revision A. Both are
//! construction properties rather than constants, because they are the one
//! thing a bootloader uses this block for: `DEV_ID` is how ST's own DFU
//! loader decides which flash geometry it is talking to.
//!
//! # Which part
//!
//! This is **RM0090's** `DBGMCU`, which is the F2/F4/F7 one. An L4's debug
//! block (RM0351 §44.9) is a different register map — `APB1FZR1` at `0x08`,
//! a second `APB1FZR2` at `0x0c` and `APB2FZR` at `0x10` — and it wants its
//! own bit table, not a fudge of this one. It is not written here because no
//! board in this tree is an L4 and a bit table nobody can check against a
//! board is worse than no bit table: the freeze bits below are each one line
//! of RM0090 §38.16.3 and §38.16.4.
//!
//! # The `u5` variant
//!
//! The STM32U5's block (`variant = "u5"`) lives at `0xE004_4000` and is the
//! wider L4-style map, per `DBGMCU_TypeDef` and the `DBGMCU_*_Pos`
//! definitions in ST CMSIS `stm32u585xx.h` (Apache-2.0) and RM0456's debug
//! chapter:
//!
//! | Offset | Register | Freeze pins |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `0x00` | `IDCODE` | — (`DEV_ID` `0x482` on a U575/U585, the `u5` default) |
//! | `0x04` | `CR` | — (`DBG_STOP` 1, `DBG_STANDBY` 2, `TRACE_IOEN` 4, `TRACE_CLKEN` 5, `TRACE_MODE` 6–7) |
//! | `0x08` | `APB1FZR1` | `tim2`…`tim7` 0–5, `wwdg` 11, `iwdg` 12, `i2c1` 21, `i2c2` 22 |
//! | `0x0C` | `APB1FZR2` | `i2c4` 1, `lptim2` 5 |
//! | `0x10` | `APB2FZR` | `tim1` 11, `tim8` 13, `tim15` 16, `tim16` 17, `tim17` 18 |
//! | `0x14` | `APB3FZR` | `i2c3` 10, `lptim1` 17, `lptim3` 18, `lptim4` 19, `rtc` 30 |
//! | `0x20` | `AHB1FZR` | `gpdma0`…`gpdma15` 0–15 |
//! | `0x28` | `AHB3FZR` | `lpdma0`…`lpdma3` 0–3 |
//!
//! The watchdog bits keep their F4 positions, in the register that took the
//! F4's `APB1_FZ` offset, so `wire dbgmcu.iwdg -> iwdg.freeze` is the same
//! line on both boards. There is no `DBG_SLEEP` on a U5. `DBGMCU_SR`, the
//! two `DBG_AUTH` mailboxes at `0xFC`–`0x108` and the CoreSight ID block at
//! `0xFD0` are not modelled: they serve a debugger's authentication protocol
//! rather than firmware, and none of them is in the CMSIS struct.
//!
//! # The freeze pins
//!
//! A stored bit that nothing consults is the defect this block exists to fix,
//! so every freeze bit this model knows is an **output pin**, and a board
//! wires it to the peripheral it freezes:
//!
//! ```text
//! wire dbgmcu.iwdg -> iwdg.freeze
//! wire dbgmcu.wwdg -> wwdg.freeze
//! ```
//!
//! The level on that pin is *the bit AND the core is halted*, which is the
//! hardware's own definition: `DBG_IWDG_STOP` reads "debug independent
//! watchdog stopped when core is halted", and a chip whose core is running
//! freezes nothing no matter what the debugger wrote.
//!
//! # How "the core is halted" gets here
//!
//! It is not a wire and it is not a register, because nothing *inside* the
//! machine knows: a gdb stub halts a core by declining to call the run loop,
//! and until this block existed there was no flag anywhere below `host/` that
//! said so. So it arrives on [`Device::debug_halt`], which
//! [`Machine::set_debug_halted`](crate::machine::Machine::set_debug_halted)
//! broadcasts and which the gdb session drives from the one place it already
//! computes running-versus-halted, once a turn, before it lets the machine
//! move. That is the whole seam; this is the only device in the tree that
//! overrides it, which is the point of a debug unit.
//!
//! # What a system reset does to it: nothing
//!
//! "This register is asynchronously reset by the POR … and not by the system
//! reset" (RM0090 §38.16.2). That is not a detail. The whole value of
//! `DBG_IWDG_STOP` is that it survives the resets the debugger is stepping
//! through, so [`Device::reset`] clears the registers on
//! [`ResetKind::Cold`] and leaves them alone otherwise.
//!
//! # Sources
//!
//! ST **RM0090** rev 21 §38 "Debug support (DBG)": §38.6.1 for `IDCODE`,
//! §38.16.2 for `CR`, §38.16.3 for `APB1_FZ` and §38.16.4 for `APB2_FZ`. The
//! address is §38.16.1. ARM **DDI 0403** B3.1 for why `0xE004_2000` is a
//! vendor address at all: `0xE0040000`–`0xE00FFFFF` is the *external* private
//! peripheral bus, which the architecture leaves implementation-defined. No
//! emulator source of any licence was consulted (`ROADMAP.md` §1).
